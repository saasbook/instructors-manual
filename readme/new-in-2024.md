# New in 2024

An executive summary of updates to the ESaaS course materials for 2024:

* The Codio-based CHIPS are being migrated to Rails 6. Expected completion is sometime in February. We will use the usual Codio process to make these available by "pulling" from the Template course, and we will also be updating the GitHub repo for those who don't use Codio.
* We have moved virtually all of the non-coding-intensive exercises (quizzes, homeworks, exams) to PrairieLearn.
* There's numerous updates to the book, most notably a list of _competencies_ at the end of most book sections. The long term goal is to provide one or more PrairieLearn questions tagged to each competency, suitable for use on homeworks or exams.
* There is a new CHIPS that is _not_&#x20;
