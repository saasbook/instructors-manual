# ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Curriculum Guidelines

We explored the 2013 ACM/IEEE Software Engineering curriculum guidelines in depth and found that our material, together with a suitable student project, covers 100% of Core Tier 1, 94% of Core Tier 2, and 66% of the electives in the curriculum guidelines.

This PDF document shows the detailed mapping between each learning outcome in the curriculum guidelines and the corresponding section of the ESaaS textbook.
