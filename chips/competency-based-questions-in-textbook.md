# Competency-Based Questions in Textbook

In the latest (2nd) edition of the [textbook](https://saasbook.info), the end of each section, in addition to featuring "Check your understanding" questions, now also identifies one or more _competencies_ associated with that sectionâ€”things the learner should be _able to do_ to demonstrate mastery of the content in that section.

A subset of these competencies is associated with PrairieLearn auto-graded questions that instructors can include in their homework assignments or quizzes. You can preview these questions as an instructor, and decide to deploy PrairieLearn to give access to your students in the form of homework or quiz questions.
