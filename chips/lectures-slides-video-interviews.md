# Lectures, Slides, Video Interviews

**Video Lecturelets**

At Berkeley, we constructed our lectures to be broken up into 7-20 minute segments. In general, each segment corresponds to a textbook section, with a few exceptions and some supplementary topics; some segments were later added or updated with studio-recorded lectures. Instructors have used these lectures to prepare/inspire their own, as well as in a flipped-classroom setting. We do both at Berkeley.

The lecturelets are organized into YouTube playlists, one playlist per chapter, and are captioned in American English. Volunteer submissions of captions (.srt files) in other languages are _most welcome!_

**Self-Check Questions to Accompany Lecturelets**

TBD

**Lecture Slides**

Most of the slides used in the lectures are available as [Google Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJpubP97LxvfJYLYXsq4JxQ-TQIWZO2f?usp=sharing) (you must be a registered instructor to access the folderâ€”see the [Welcome](../) page). Again, there have been a few updates, and a few decks that need updating, but these may be useful as a starting point.

**SaaS TV interviews**

This [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMMGxq3FPxiFmDh98ysUroIhmkewfO4i) contains interviews with a number of working engineers who do ESaaS, giving weight and credibility to some of the topics covered in the syllabus. These are uncaptioned; captioned submissions welcome.

**Short videos about the course**

This [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMMGxq3FPxjyflGWxsutxceHqBHk7Oyc) includes (as of 2022) the following **uncaptioned** videos (caption submissions welcome):

* a welcome from Armando Fox and Dave Patterson
* an interview with a customer of our student projects created in the course
* an exhortation from Google's VP of Engineering about the importance of teamwork in software engineering
* a short piece on the role of GitHub and open source in software engineering team projects and collaboration in this course
