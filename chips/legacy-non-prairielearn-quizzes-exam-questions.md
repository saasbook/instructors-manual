# Legacy (non-PrairieLearn) Quizzes/Exam Questions

### Open ended questions for written exams ([instructor access only](https://www.saasbook.info/instructors))

[Open-ended response questions](https://github.com/saasbook/open-response-exam-questions) suitable for manual grading, along with reference solutions. Most of these have been converted to “Artisan” Exam Questions delivered through PrairieLearn.

### Multiple-choice/machine-gradable questions ([instructor access only](https://www.saasbook.info/instructors))

[Multiple choice questions](https://github.com/saasbook/csw169a-quizzes) grouped by textbook chapter. The [RuQL gem](https://github.com/saasbook/ruql) and its associated formatters let you export quiz questions to HTML/hardcopy, the Canvas LMS, and other quiz formats. This is a subset of all the questions in the PrairieLearn per-chapter quizzes.
