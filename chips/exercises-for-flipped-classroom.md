# Exercises for Flipped Classroom



The [courseware repo](https://github.com/saasbook/courseware) (public, but for some links you need to be a member of either "ESaaS instructors" (read only) or "CS169 GSIs" (read/write)) has lots of worksheets, interactive activities, etc. with instructor-facing README files and organized by chapter of the book.

* `courseware/flipped-demos` includes a variety of livecoding demos with instructor support materials, such as prompting questions and a "script" for doing the livecoding.
* `courseware/discussion` contains worksheets, solutions, and code grouped by each module, suitable for use in hands-on small-section classes or for self-learning.
* `courseware/practice-exams` contains midterms from UC Berkeley and others using the materials that are suitable as practice exams.
