# Codio

By far the recommended way to do the programming and other assignments (CHIPS, see below) is the [Codio](https://codio.com/esaas) IDE. Codio includes the correct versions of all the necessary tools and libraries; the programming assignments; the autograders; "scaffolding" for the programming assignments woven into the assignments themselves;  and even the textbook sections correctly interleaved with the assignments, including the "self check" questions in the textbook.

You can also use Codio for coding exams (see left).

There is a modest fee to use Codio; it can be paid by the student or you can negotiate a classroom or site license directly.

Codio is very enlightened about providing a limited number of "access codes" for students for whom paying the fee is a financial hardship. Contact your Codio rep and ask them for "bookstore codes," which students can then redeem using [this process](https://docs.codio.com/students/accessing-codio/paying.html#redeeming-code-from-campus-bookstore).

All in all, Codio have been extremely supportive in helping to make teaching this material a low-friction experience. We're grateful for their help and encourage you to adopt the platform, as all future innovation around ESaaS programming assignments will use this platform.
