# Gradescope

The general process for using Gradescope is to set up an autogradable assignment in Gradescope for each of the programming assignments you want to use. You will need access to instructor-only GitHub repos to do this.

1. Check if you have access to the GitHub repo [saasbook/chips](https://github.com/saasbook/chips). If not, email [instructor-support@saasbook.info](mailto:instructor-support@saasbook.info) with your GitHub username and proof of your instructor standing (e.g. URL to your institutional home page) to get added.
2. Use this [pre-approved link](https://www.gradescope.com/?utm\_campaign=user-invite\&utm\_source=esaas%20instructor) to sign up for a Gradescope account, if you don't have one already.
3. [Create a course](https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-courses-edit) in Gradescope.
4. \[Instructions need to be updated for new CHIPS format]&#x20;
