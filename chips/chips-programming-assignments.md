# CHIPS (Programming assignments)

To complement the Content-Oriented Didactic (COD) materials such as the book and lectures, CHIPS (Coding & Hands-on Integrated Projects) provide hands-on skills practice and are keyed to specific sections in the book. This section describes how to use them with Codio. The [book's website](http://www.saasbook.info/instructors) has other options if you don't wish to use Codio, but we have pretty extensive automated workflows that are optimized for Codio, for publishing both the book content itself and these CHIPS along with their autograders.

If you're using Codio, all you really need to know is how the CHIPS work—see below. If you want to use the CHIPS outside of Codio, or contribute to their development, look at the README in the CHIPS [repo](https://github.com/saasbook/chips) (visible to [registered instructors](https://www.saasbook.info/instructors)).

Here's a quick summary of the assignments, presented in the order in which they appear in the [ESaaS textbook](http://www.saasbook.info). There are three types:

1. **Autograded using Codio:** The solutions repos include reference solutions, Codio-based autograders in the Codio course, and files for manually configuring [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com)-based autograding. (Gradescope is no longer officially supported, so use those files at your own risk.)
2. **PrairieLearn autograding:** The questions are done in the PrairieLearn assessment authoring system and have autograders there.
3. **Self-graded:** CHIPS involves coding, but rather than an autograder, includes tests students run themselves. It's up to you to verify if they've done so.
4. **Comprehension:** CHIPS involves minimal or no coding, but rather performing some tasks and answering self-check questions about them. The tasks can be performed in the Codio IDE's terminal window, and the questions are built into the Codio version of the assignment. They are unlimited-attempt selected-response/short-answer questions.

The relative effort of each CHIPS is indicated by one bullet (a couple of hours of work), two bullets (several hours of work), or three bullets (a potentially multi-day assignment). Here are the book sections in which the CHIPS occur, along with their difficulty.

### Optional additional CHIPS (not referenced in textbook)

* [Oracle of Bacon](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-oracle-of-bacon): Build a simple command-line app that uses external services in a SOA, including parsing XML responses.
* [Design Review](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-design-review): We use this in the project portion of the course. This is not a programming assignment but rather a 3-part scaffolded process for doing design reviews and technical presentations. (Each part can be used more or less independently.) It is intended to be used in conjunction with student teams doing their own open-ended projects, so no code is provided. In part 1 (Design Review), teams are paired up and each team evaluates the other's design and gives feedback on possible improvements. In part 2 (Presentation), teams give technical presentations about the design review; these are peer-evaluated (or instructor-evaluated) according to a provided rubric. In part 3 (Handoff), teams modify their repos as needed to ensure the project is easy for another team to pick up and continue working on.
